# Governance Voter Snapshot Program

[← Back to Project README](../../README.md)

## Purpose

This program enables whitelisted operators to vote on stake distribution snapshots that will be used for governance voting. It provides consensus functionality for agreeing on a snapshot, along with helper instructions to verify stake weights from the agreed-upon snapshot.

## Program Accounts and Instructions

### Account Types

| Account Type      | Purpose                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BallotBox`       | Stores voting state, consensus threshold, and ballot configuration.                |
| `ConsensusResult` | Stores the finalized `meta_merkle_root` and `snapshot_hash` for a completed vote.  |
| `MetaMerkleProof` | Stores the proof data required to verify a single validator’s stake in a snapshot. |
| `ProgramConfig`   | Stores program-wide configuration, including admin and global operator whitelist.  |

## Design Constraints and Considerations

### 1. Merkle Tree Format

Snapshots are structured as a two-tier Merkle tree:

- [`MetaMerkleSnapshot`](../../cli/src/merkle.rs#L11): encapsulates the top-level Merkle root, snapshot slot, and all associated leaf bundles.
- [`MetaMerkleLeaf`](../../programs/gov-v1/src/state/proof.rs#L40): represents a `VoteAccount` node in the top-level Merkle tree, containing the subroot of its delegated stake tree and total stake.
- [`StakeMerkleLeaf`](../../programs/gov-v1/src/state/proof.rs#L64): represents a `StakeAccount` leaf in the bottom-level Merkle tree, containing the voting wallet, stake pubkey, and active delegated stake.

All hashing uses SHA-256 and follows Solana canonical Merkle tree layout (`left || right`, sorted lexicographically by node).

---

### 2. Transaction Size Limits

Solana enforces a strict 1232-byte limit on transaction payloads. Based on current Solana Mainnet statistics, there are 1087 active validators with the largest validator Everstake having 195492 delegated stake accounts. To ensure that `verify` instructions remain composable on extremely large validator and stake account sets, even in CPI calls from a voting program:

- The ConsensusResult account stores only the finalized `meta_merkle_root` and `snapshot_hash`, minimizing CU utilization.
- `MetaMerkleProof` is used to store the leaf data and proof required to verify stake weight of a single validator in a snapshot, reducing transaction payload of the subsequent `verify` instruction.
- The `verify` instruction is invoked separately (through CPI from the voting program) to verify either the stake weight of a vote account or a stake account.
- `MetaMerkleProof` is intended to be initialized once per validator per governance vote, typically by the first voter. Subsequent voters for the same validator reuse this proof account without having to reinitialize.
- `MetaMerkleProof` can be closed before the indicated expiry time by its creator or permissionlessly after expiry.
- Supporting UI should handle edge cases of checking the existence and initializing of `MetaMerkleProof` if needed, and closing it after end of voting.

---

### 3. Operator Voting

Operator voting has the following constraints:

- A maximum of 64 operators can be whitelisted for voting concurrently
- The `min_consensus_threshold_bps` is fixed at the time of `BallotBox` initialization and cannot be changed.
- All whitelisted operators have equal voting weight.
- Operators can continue to cast votes after consensus is reached, though votes cannot be removed once cast.
- There is a limit of 64 unique ballots that can be cast, including any ballots where votes were subsequently reduced to 0.

### 4. Operator Whitelisting

As any addition or removal of Operators will affect the consensus threshold count, this should be done after the completion of any balloting. There are no guardrails around preventing of changes to the whitelist while voting is ongoing.

---

### 5. Snapshot Identity and Uniqueness

Each snapshot is uniquely identified by its `snapshot_hash`, defined as the SHA-256 hash of the Borsh-serialized `MetaMerkleSnapshot`. This enables UIs and operators to confirm that any off-chain file corresponds to an on-chain ConsensusResult.

---

### 6. Tie Breaking

If consensus is not reached before `vote_expiry_timestamp`, the `tie_breaker_admin` is allowed to select any ballot in the BallotBox. This ensures liveness and allows governance recovery from operator deadlock.
